# Where and What? Examining Interpretable Disentangled Representations (CVPR 2021)

## 概述

### 从三方面评估解耦
+ Informativeness
+ Independence
+ Interpretability

### 一个问题

能否在没有监督的情况下要求特征的可解释性？  

### 两个假设
+ Spatial Constriction : A representation is usually interpretable if we can consistently tell where the controlled variations are in an image.
+ Perceptual Simplicity: An interpretable code usually corresponds to a concept consisting of perceptually simple variations.
